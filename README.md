for jarvis to function you need Pyaudio. In this repository I have gave you an original copy of PyAudio, but you might have problems downloading Pyaudio using pip install Pyaudio

instead you have to use the two set of code below

pip install pipwin

pipwin install pyaudio

Finally run Jarvis and have fun.

There are some packages you have to install using the pip command
such as =
pip install speech_recognition 
pip install pyttsx3
pip install datetime
pip install wikipedia
pip install webbrowser
pip install ecapture==0.0.7
pip install wolframalpha
pip install requests
