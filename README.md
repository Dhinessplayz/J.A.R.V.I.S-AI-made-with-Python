for jarvis to function you need Pyaudio. In this repository I have gave you an original copy of PyAudio, but you might have problems downloading Pyaudio using pip install Pyaudio

instead you have to use the two set of code below

pip install pipwin

pipwin install pyaudio

Finally run Jarvis and have fun.
