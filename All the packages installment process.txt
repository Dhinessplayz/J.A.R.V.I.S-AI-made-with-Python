for jarvis to function you need Pyaudio.
In this repository I have gave you an original copy of PyAudio,
but you might have problems downloading Pyaudio using pip install Pyaudio. Instead follow the pip install command for all the packages below

pip install pipwin (Used to install PyAudio)
pipwin install pyaudio (Used to install PyAudio)

pip install speech_recognition 
pip install pyttsx3
pip install datetime
pip install wikipedia
pip install webbrowser
pip install ecapture==0.0.7
pip install wolframalpha
pip install requests

Finally run J.A.R.V.I.S and have fun
